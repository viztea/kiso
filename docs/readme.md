## Opinionated

If you've used or browsed this repo at all, you may have noticed the use of snake case instead of the kotlin standard of
camel case.

This is a pretty opinionated library, and this is the boldest of my opinions. I simply prefer snake case, and
if you have a problem with that (and have a legitimate reason to use my library), I'm open to feedback.
